# Boundless, bottomless, New York City



After living in the area for nearly five years, I am finally moving into New
York City proper. I wanted to reflect on the beauty and sheer imposing scale of
the city.

It is a place of contrasts.

There is something about this city that will make you and break you.

Nobody ends up here by accident. You end up in New York if you have something
to prove.
