# Why not both

## MBTI

MBTI is a popular way to categorize personality. Some consider it as a
pseudoscience, but I think such criticism misses the point. It is useful simply
as a vocabulary to discuss the different ways people approach the world. Under
MBTI, you evaluate your approach to the worldalong four axes:

   <td><b>F</b>eeling. You approach the world with care and empathy.</td>

<tr>
   <td><b>J</b>udging. You are disciplined, organized, and have a strong sense of how things ought to be.</td>
   <td>vs.</td>
   <td><b>P</b>erceiving. You are spontaneous, flexible, and adaptable as things change.</td>
</tr>
</table>

- Introversion (**I**) versus extraversion (**E**). Do you recover energy by being around others, or by being alone?
- **S**, sensing: You live firmly in the physical world as it really exists<br>
  **N**, intuitive: You live in an internal world of ideals and possibilities
- **T**, thinking: You find your way through the world using logic and reason<br>
  **F**, feeling: You find your way through the world by empathizing and
  engaging with other people
- **J**, judging: You have a firm idea of how things *ought to be*<br>
  **P**, perceiving: You are more flexible and go-with-the-flow

By taking all combinations of these four pairs, you come up with an MBTI type.
For example, my own type is **INTP**.

There's a more insidious thing these tests can do, which is self-reinforce. If
you take a test and are told that you are an **INTP**, you might start to
identify strongly with that type. You'll read personality profiles, nod
aggressively along with everything that fits you, and think "oh maybe I
*should* behave that way" with things that don't.

So recently I've started thinking of each MBTI axis not as a scale, where being
better at one thing necessarily makes you worse off at the opposite.

Rather, you can imagine there being a skill bar extending from the center in
both directions.

Take thinking vs. feeling. Nothing prevents a person from being able to use
logic *and* empathy in dealing with the world. It's natural to have tendency
towards one or the other. But they are both useful skills in different
contexts, and a well balanced person can employ *both*.

So it goes with all four letters.
