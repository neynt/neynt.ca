## Kabukicho

I had previously heard of Kabukicho as the birthplace of *jirai-kei*. I spent a
few nights.

It is the incarnation of commoditized intimacy. Money, we are taught, can be
exchanged for goods and services

## Yukiya Niigata

I stood outside the restaurant in the rain, tentative. Am I even allowed to be
here? Would I be welcomed, accepted? There are two patrons in the restaurant
already. Would a solo diner at this time be an inconvenience?

I almost left. Then another couple arrived and walked in. And I followed.

1. Hotaru Ika (firefly squid, a springtime specialty)
2. Hirame (olive flounder)
3. Yari Ika (spear squid)
4. Uni (sea urchin)
5. Hotate (scallop)
6. Sayori (Japanese halfbeak)
7. Sayori no kawa (Skin of the Japanese halfbeak)
8. Nodoguro (Blackthroat seaperch)
9. Otoro (fatty tuna)
10. Amaeba (sweet shrimp)
11. Yari Ika (??)
12. Kohada (gizzard shad)
13. Anago (saltwater eel)

own visits to Japan may benefit.

## Tokyo

I stayed two nights at the Hotel Gracery Shinjuku in the heart of Kabukicho.
I had previously only heard of Kabukicho as the district of Tokyo in which
*jirai-kei* originated, and it carried little other meaning to me.

Staying in two nights in this accursed location sure gave it meaning.

Kabukicho is 

People are, as is the case across the city, exceptionally well dressed. But
the flavor of dress differs.

One amusing moment happened when I engaged with one of the girls advertising a
local business. She was dressed very fashionably and was advertising a *concept
cafe*. When I asked which concept, she pointed to her own outfit -- a somewhat
Victorian punk. I pulled out my own Vivienne Westwood necklace. "Osoroi desu
ne".

## Niigata

The first thing people will say when you tell them that you're going to Niigata
is "why". Niigata is not quite at the top of anyone's
