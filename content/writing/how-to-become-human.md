# how to become human

## motive

There is a certain kind of person who struggles deeply with the interpersonal.
It is as if at birth, the part of the brain that is supposed to interpret other
people's brain states—intentions, cues, emotions—was swapped out for something
else, something that really likes numbers and structure and Minecraft. It
*wouldn't quite* be considered autism by modern psychiatry, but it rhymes.

These people are kindred spirits to me. They are *my people*.

People in this category tend to have struggled to fit in during childhood. In
adulthood, society values them in technical roles, but they have trouble making
and keeping friends, and dating. Some are content to live a life of quiet
isolation. Some get frustrated and turn their anger inward, and find community
in such groups as incels or PUAs.

This is deeply tragic. It is a huge loss of human potential.

And it's completely needless. Social skills *can* be learned, even for an
irredeemable shape rotator such as myself. You can rewire your brain to be more
empathetic, engaged, and pleasant to talk to. And I've found the unlikeliest
teacher: ChatGPT.

## how to use this guide

1. **Engage** in the roleplay scenario with GPT.
2. **Ask for feedback**. Unguided practice will only serve to reinforce your
   existing habits. Always be asking the chatbot how you can do better, how it
   would have ideally phrased responses. Take that feedback to heart. Keep
   trying variations on the scenario until it is second nature.
3. **Do it for real**. Apply what you've learned to real life. You should feel
   new possibilities open themselves up in your mind's eye.
