# Worthy of love

I reckon I have spent more time than most people on making myself worthy of
love.

On its face, this sounds absurd and dystopic. We are taught, ideally, from a
young age, that love is meant to be given freely, unconditionally.

That is of course impossible. No one can give love forever without *something*
being reciprocated.

Eternity is, for the most part, a polite fiction. A lie we believe in to stay
sane.

What is love in the first place? Love is anything but rational. It is a feeling
of deep admiration and care for the object of affection. It is a desire to see
it reach its full potential, to attain happiness, and attain its own agency.

Love casts everything you do in a good light. Every action is a delight, every
statement full of insight, and any misstep is easily forgotten.

So then what is the currency you use to buy love?

I've done some thinking about it. I think what makes you loved is beauty.

People are drawn to love that which is beautiful.

In contemporary Western culture, and especially for women, this can be very
literal.
