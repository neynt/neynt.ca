## Fey mood driven software development

In Dwarf Fortress, your dwarves will, every once in a while, be struck with a
fey mood. They will hole up in a workshop, demand specific materials, and not
leave until they have made a legendary artifact.

Sounds like programming

## Cyberpunk dystopia

## Reconciling

## The indistinguishable fake

## Becoming human, for shape rotators
