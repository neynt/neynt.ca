# The world in here, the world out there

In life you navigate two worlds.

One I call "the world out there". This is the world of physical reality. Of
securing food and shelter, of erecting skyscrapers and bridges that don't
collapse, of figuring out that a microprocessor leaks information in how
quickly it executes instructions, of sending a trade that makes you a
statistical fraction of a penny a microsecond faster than your competitors.

The other I call "the world in here". This is the world of social reality, of
purely what goes on in people's minds. The world of social reality. Of
friendships, enemies, allegiances, betrayals.

Most notably, the world in here is the world of love.

In the world out there, your weapon is rationality. There's a system that you
aim to understand such that you may predict it and control it. To do so, you
form and check mental models, attempt to describe the world, and update your
understanding as you learn.

In the world in here, your weapon is, largely, charisma. And I like to break
that down into empathy and delusion.
